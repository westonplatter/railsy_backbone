# RailsyBackbone

## Features

### Nested model attributes
Allows you to specify a namespace for model attributes by defining a  ```paramRoot```  attribute. For example, 

```javascript
var Book = Backbone.Model.extend({ 
  url: '/books',
  paramRoot: 'book'
});

var book_instance = new Book({ 
  title:  'the illiad', 
  author: 'homer'
});

book_instance.sync();
```

This will cause the HTTP POST to look like this, 

```sh
Started POST "/books" for 127.0.0.1 at 2013-08-03 18:08:56 -0600
  Processing by BooksController#create as JSON
  Parameters: { "book" => { "title" => "the illiad", "author" => "home" }}
```
